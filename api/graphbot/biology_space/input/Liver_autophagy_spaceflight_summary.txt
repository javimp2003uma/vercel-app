Spaceflight Activates Autophagy Programs and the Proteasome in Mouse Liver
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This study examines how spaceflight impacts liver metabolism and stress responses in mice using integrated transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses. Mice flown on the Space Shuttle Atlantis (STS-135) for 13.5 days showed significant alterations in oxidative defense, autophagy, proteasome activation, and senescence pathways. The results highlight the vulnerability of the liver, a mitochondria-rich organ, to oxidative stress during spaceflight.

Background
-----------
• Spaceflight stressors (microgravity, low-dose radiation, psychological/environmental stress, microbial exposure) increase reactive oxygen species (ROS).  
• ROS damage DNA, proteins, and lipids, leading to apoptosis, senescence, and inflammation.  
• Astronauts often show impaired glucose regulation and signs of metabolic stress.  
• Previous work found decreased hepatic glutathione and increased markers of oxidative damage in spaceflown mice. This study expands the analysis using whole metabolomic and transcriptomic datasets.  

Methods
--------
• **Animals**: Female C57BL/6J mice (9 weeks old, n=15/group), flown for 13.5 days or housed as ground controls in matched Animal Enclosure Modules (AEMs).  
• **Samples**: Liver tissues collected within 3–5 h of shuttle landing.  
• **Analyses**:  
  - Metabolomics (LC/MS, GC/MS) for small molecule profiling.  
  - Transcriptomics (Affymetrix GeneChip arrays).  
  - Integrated pathway enrichment using MetaboAnalyst, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), and Exploratory Gene Association Networks (EGAN).  
  - Histology for lipid accumulation and inflammation.  

Results
--------
1. **Metabolite changes**  
   - Significant separation between flight (FLT) and ground (AEM) mice.  
   - Increased: 3-hydroxybutyrate, glutarate, propionylcarnitine, ophthalmate (marker of GSH depletion).  
   - Decreased: glutathione, glycerophosphorylcholine, cystathionine.  
   - Patterns suggest impaired glutathione metabolism, oxidative stress, and dehydration.  
   - Osmolytes betaine and taurine were elevated, linked to water intake reduction (~20%).  

2. **Histology**  
   - FLT mice had increased lipid droplets (steatosis) and infiltration of inflammatory cells.  
   - Suggests impaired membrane metabolism and inflammation.  

3. **Transcriptomics**  
   - ~3000 genes significantly altered; 601 biologically relevant (449 up, 152 down).  
   - Upregulated: genes for metabolism, DNA repair, autophagy (Atg2a, LC3, Wipi1/2), proteasome subunits, peroxisomal genes.  
   - Downregulated: NRF2 pathway (oxidative defense), immune regulation, lipid metabolism.  
   - Cell cycle regulators indicated senescence induction (↑ CDKN1a/p21, INK4C/p18).  

4. **Integrated analysis**  
   - Enriched pathways: glycerophospholipid/sphingolipid metabolism, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, purine metabolism, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis.  
   - Evidence for mitochondrial dysfunction and defective tRNA modification.  
   - Autophagy and proteasome activation consistent with attempts to degrade oxidized proteins.  
   - NRF2 oxidative defense downregulated, exacerbating oxidative damage.  

5. **Senescence and mitochondrial dysfunction**  
   - Data suggest hepatocyte senescence driven by oxidative stress, protein aggregation, and impaired clearance.  
   - Upregulation of p21 and p38 MAPK links to mitochondrial dysfunction and lipid accumulation.  
   - Phenotype resembles aging and obesity-related liver disease.  

Discussion
-----------
• Short-term spaceflight (13.5 days) significantly altered liver metabolism.  
• Impaired oxidative defense and NRF2 downregulation promote ROS damage.  
• Activation of autophagy and proteasome indicates cellular attempts to maintain homeostasis, but persistent stress may induce senescence.  
• Choline depletion and altered osmolyte balance reflect dehydration and disrupted lipid metabolism.  
• Liver steatosis and inflammation parallel astronaut observations of metabolic stress.  

Conclusion
-----------
• Spaceflight induces oxidative stress, impaired antioxidant defense, autophagy, proteasome activation, and senescence in mouse liver.  
• Mitochondrial dysfunction and altered membrane metabolism suggest vulnerability to chronic liver damage.  
• Findings provide insight into spaceflight-induced metabolic disorders and potential risks of liver disease in astronauts.  

Implications for Spaceflight
-----------------------------
• Long-duration missions may accelerate liver aging, steatosis, and metabolic dysfunction.  
• Monitoring hepatic biomarkers (glutathione, ophthalmate, serum lipids) may aid astronaut health surveillance.  
• Countermeasures: antioxidants, NRF2 activators, hydration strategies, and therapies targeting autophagy/proteasome balance.
