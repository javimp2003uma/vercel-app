Abstract (Summary)
The mollusk statocyst, a gravity-sensing organ, has strong structural and functional similarities to vertebrate vestibular systems.
This study used terrestrial snails (*Helix lucorum* and *Helix aspersa*) to assess the effects of 12- and 16-day spaceflights
(Foton M-2 and M-3 missions). Analyses included: (i) whole-animal behavior (negative gravitaxis), (ii) statoreceptor
electrophysiology, and (iii) neuropeptide gene expression (Helix pedal peptide, HPep; and FMRFamide). Results showed:
- Faster gravitaxis response in postflight snails.
- Enhanced sensitivity of statocyst responses to tilt, independent of direction, with larger firing magnitude postflight.
- Increased expression of HPep gene in statocyst receptors, but no changes in FMRFamide expression.
Overall, microgravity exposure upregulated statocyst function, paralleling vertebrate vestibular adaptations to spaceflight.

Introduction
Gravity has been constant throughout evolution, shaping sensory systems across metazoans. The snail statocyst resembles
vertebrate otolith organs in structure and function: statoconia (otoconia in mammals), supporting cells, and sensory hair
cells. Spaceflight enables study of whether gravisensing systems adapt to altered gravitational states. This research examined
behavioral, physiological, and molecular responses in snails exposed to microgravity, providing a simple invertebrate
model for understanding general mechanisms of gravity sensing.

Methods
- Missions: Foton M-2 (16 days) and Foton M-3 (12 days).
- Animals: *Helix lucorum* (large snails) for behavioral/electrophysiological studies; *Helix aspersa* (small snails) for
  gene expression.
- Behavioral tests: negative gravitaxis (reorientation following sudden head-down pitch).
- Electrophysiology: extracellular recordings from statocyst nerve during tilt at different angles and speeds.
- Gene expression: in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry for HPep and FMRFamide in CNS and statocysts.
- Controls: asynchronous ground experiments simulating temperature and habitat conditions.

Results
1. **Behavior (Negative gravitaxis):**
   - Postflight snails reoriented faster than controls (significant differences at later phases of reorientation).
   - Both Foton M-2 and M-3 missions confirmed enhanced negative gravitaxis postflight.

2. **Electrophysiology:**
   - Spontaneous firing rates unchanged between groups.
   - Tilt responses significantly enhanced postflight: larger spike counts, increased sensitivity across tilt speeds.
   - Directional preference (head-down > tail-down) seen in controls was absent in postflight snails, indicating loss of
     orientation selectivity.

3. **Gene Expression:**
   - HPep gene expression upregulated in statocyst receptors postflight (50% of M-2, ~91% of M-3 statocysts stained).
   - FMRFamide expression unchanged in postflight vs controls, suggesting it is not involved in adaptation.
   - HPep upregulation likely linked to ciliary beating and mechanical transduction adjustments.

---

Discussion
- Microgravity exposure enhanced statocyst sensitivity and behavioral performance in gravitaxis.
- Loss of directional selectivity suggests functional re-tuning of gravisensing under altered gravity.
- Upregulation of HPep implies molecular plasticity in mechanosensory hair cells adapting to new gravity states.
- Parallels with vertebrate vestibular hypersensitivity after spaceflight suggest conserved mechanisms of gravisensing
across evolution.
- Potential mechanisms: structural changes in statoconia, synaptic remodeling, altered ionic channel dynamics, and efferent
neural feedback regulation.

---

Conclusion
- Snails exposed to microgravity showed faster behavioral responses, enhanced statocyst sensitivity, and increased HPep
gene expression in statocyst receptors.
- Adaptations resemble vertebrate vestibular changes post-spaceflight, underscoring fundamental principles of gravity
sensing.
- Snails provide a valuable, simple model for studying subcellular and systems-level adaptations of nervous systems to
microgravity.
