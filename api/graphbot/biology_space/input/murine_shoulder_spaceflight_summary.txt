Abstract (Summary)
The musculoskeletal system depends on mechanical loading to maintain structural integrity.
Disuse, paralysis, or microgravity can lead to bone and tendon deterioration, but little is known
about effects at the tendon-bone interface (enthesis), which is prone to tears and injury. This study
examined unloading effects on adult mouse shoulder entheses after 21 days of paralysis induced by
botulinum toxin A. Unloading increased failure risk and caused multiscale structural changes: bone
loss at the millimeter scale, smaller and less aligned mineral crystals at the micrometer scale, and
compositional stiffening of mineral at the nanometer scale. These combined to elevate stress
concentrations and reduce energy absorption capacity, increasing risk of injury.

Introduction
Mechanical loading is critical for bone, tendon, and enthesis homeostasis. Loss of loading due to
spaceflight or paralysis reduces bone mass, tendon stiffness, and overall musculoskeletal strength.
The enthesis, where tendon attaches to bone, is highly specialized with gradients in mineral
content and collagen orientation to dissipate stress. Previous work showed loading is essential for
enthesis development, but effects of unloading on the mature enthesis remain unclear. This study
hypothesized that unloading would compromise mechanics and induce structural changes across
hierarchical scales (nano, micro, and macro).

Methods
- Animal Model: 40 adult male CD-1 mice (30–34 weeks old).
- Groups: Control (normal cage activity), and Botox-injected (left supraspinatus paralyzed, right
injected with saline as control).
- Duration: 21 days.
- Analyses:
  - μCT imaging for bone morphology.
  - Uniaxial tensile testing for enthesis mechanics.
  - Raman spectroscopy, synchrotron XRD/XRF, and TEM-EELS for mineral gradients and
    nanostructure.
- Outcome measures: mechanical strength, toughness, trabecular bone volume, mineral gradient
width, mineral orientation, crystal size, carbonate substitution.

Results
1. **Mechanical testing (millimeter scale):**
   - Unloading did not alter stiffness or maximum force of enthesis.
   - However, failure area increased and fracture toughness decreased with unloading.
   - Strength trended lower in Botox group, suggesting greater vulnerability to failure.

2. **Bone morphology (micrometer scale):**
   - Bone volume fraction decreased ~40% with unloading (control BV/TV 0.44 → botox 0.27).
   - Trabecular thickness reduced; spacing increased.
   - Larger failure craters at attachment sites in unloaded samples.

3. **Mineral gradient and structure:**
   - XRF showed steeper Ca gradients and narrower mineral transition zone in Botox-treated
     entheses (~8 µm vs ~15 µm in controls).
   - Raman-based measurements of gradient width unchanged, but unloading altered mineral
     alignment.

4. **Nanostructural changes:**
   - Mineral crystals smaller and less aligned in unloaded samples.
   - Residual strain patterns altered, indicating compromised mechanical integration.
   - RMS strain decreased, suggesting less heterogeneous mineral environments.
   - Carbonate substitution reduced in botox-treated samples, known to increase mineral stiffness.

5. **Compositional mapping (TEM-EELS):**
   - Mineral deposition shifted from predominantly extrafibrillar to combined intra- and
     extrafibrillar across gradient zones.
   - Unloading did not change this transition, but mineral disorder increased.

Discussion
- Unloading of shoulder entheses increased susceptibility to avulsion and failure, even though
elastic properties and tendon structure remained unchanged.
- Multiscale changes explained increased injury risk:
  - **Macro-scale:** trabecular bone loss weakened structural support.
  - **Micro-scale:** smaller, misaligned crystals decreased compliant zone energy dissipation.
  - **Nano/atomic scale:** reduced carbonate content stiffened mineral, limiting energy absorption.
- Findings align with clinical observations of rotator cuff avulsion injuries, especially in young
adults, highlighting how enthesis health depends on loading.
- Spaceflight unloading may similarly increase shoulder injury risk in astronauts.

---

Conclusion
- Short-term unloading of adult mouse shoulder entheses caused significant structural and
mechanical compromise across hierarchical scales.
- Effects include bone loss, altered mineral gradients, reduced toughness, and stiffer mineral
composition, together elevating risk of failure.
- These findings provide insight into enthesis biology under unloading and inform therapeutic
approaches for musculoskeletal injuries in disuse, paralysis, and spaceflight.
