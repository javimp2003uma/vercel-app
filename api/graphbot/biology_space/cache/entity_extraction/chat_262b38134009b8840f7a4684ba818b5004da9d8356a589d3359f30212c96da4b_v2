RNA sequencing revealed that microgravity induced significant \ntranscriptional changes linked to oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and lipid metabolic stress. Artificial gravity attenuated these effects in a \ndose-dependent manner, with the strongest protection at 1 G. Immunohistochemistry confirmed that AG reduced oxidative stress biomarker (4-HNE) levels. \nThese results suggest AG may be a viable countermeasure to protect ocular health during spaceflight.\n\n---\n\nIntroduction\nAstronauts on long-duration spaceflight often develop ocular abnormalities grouped as SANS, including optic disc edema and retinal changes. \nPast rodent studies demonstrated disruption of retinal structure and blood-retinal barrier integrity. Few studies have explored how AG counteracts \nmicrogravity’s ocular effects. Using centrifugation on ISS, this study evaluated transcriptomic and oxidative stress responses of ON and RTN to \nprogressive levels of AG. The goal was to identify whether AG could mitigate microgravity-induced damage and determine the most effective \ngravitational dose.\n\n---\n\nMethods\n- Model: 24 male C57BL/6J mice, launched on SpaceX CRS-27 for a 30-day ISS mission (MHU-8).\n- Groups: 0 G (microgravity), 0.33 G, 0.67 G, 1 G (centrifugation), plus habitat ground controls (HGC).\n- Tissues analyzed: Optic nerve and retina.\n- RNA sequencing: High-quality RNA extracted, libraries prepared with Illumina Ribo-Zero, sequenced on NovaSeq 6000.\n- Bioinformatics: Reads aligned with STAR, quantified with RSEM, normalized with DESeq2. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified at |log2FC|>1, adj p<0.05.\n- Pathway analysis: Enrichment using KEGG pathways.\n- Oxidative stress: Immunofluorescence staining of 4-HNE in retinal layers.\n- Comparisons: Transcriptomic profiles between FLT and HGC, and effects of different AG levels.\n\n---\n\nResults\n1. **Spaceflight transcriptomic effects (0 G vs HGC):**\n   - 206 DEGs in ON, 285 in RTN.\n   - Pathways enriched: FoxO, PI3k-Akt, p53 (ON); PPAR and p53 (RTN).\n   - Transcriptomic overlap with optic nerve crush and glaucoma models suggests parallels with degenerative disease.\n\n2. **Effect of AG on transcriptome:**\n   - Increasing AG progressively reduced DEG numbers.\n   - At 1 G, gene expression closely resembled HGC patterns.\n   - 0.33 G ON group showed anomalies likely due to technical artifacts.\n\n3. **Pathway-specific attenuation:**\n   - FoxO, PI3k-Akt, p53 (ON) and PPAR, p53 (RTN) responses were attenuated by AG, strongest at 1 G.\n\n4. **Overlap analysis:**\n   - Comparison of FLT 0 G vs HGC DEGs with FLT 0 G vs FLT 1 G DEGs confirmed attenuation at 1 G.\n   - Example: Pdk4 expression in ON and Cdkn1a in RTN returned to HGC-like levels at 1 G.\n\n5. **Oxidative stress biomarker (4-HNE):**\n   - Elevated at 0 G and 0.33 G in ganglion cell layer of retina.\n   - Reduced to HGC-like levels at 0.67 G and 1 G.\n   - Suggests AG above 0.67 G effectively suppresses oxidative stress.\n\n---\n\nDiscussion\n- Spaceflight triggers transcriptomic alterations in ON and RTN, associated with oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and lipid dysregulation.\n- Continuous AG counteracts these changes in a dose-dependent manner, strongest at 1 G.\n- The ON and RTN responded differently, reflecting distinct structural and vascular properties.\n- Pathway analysis highlights p53, FoxO, PI3k-Akt, and PPAR signaling as critical mediators of stress responses.\n- Oxidative stress reduction by AG suggests protective effects against retinal gliosis and Müller cell activation.\n- While microgravity is the main driver, other stressors (cosmic radiation, magnetic fields, hypergravity) may play minor roles, but their impact was limited in this 30-day mission.\n- Future research should explore longer missions, combined space stressors, and sex-specific responses (this study used only male mice).\n\n---\n\nConclusion\n- Microgravity induces harmful transcriptomic and oxidative stress responses in optic nerve and retina.\n- Artificial gravity (≥0.67 G, especially 1 G) strongly attenuates these effects, restoring gene expression closer to ground controls.\n- AG represents a promising countermeasure to prevent or reduce ocular injury and SANS in astronauts during long-duration spaceflight.\n\n---\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
