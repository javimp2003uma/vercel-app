Key enzymes—*gba-4* and *asm-3*—were downregulated, reducing ceramide biosynthesis and degradation. LC/MS/MS data confirmed metabolic shifts:\n- Total ceramide ↓ 1.5×\n- Hexosylceramide ↓ 3.6×\n- Sphingosine ↓ 1.4×\n- Lactosylceramide ↑ 27× (p < 0.05)\n\nThese lipid changes imply reduced sphingolipid turnover and potentially increased longevity, as ceramide depletion is linked to lifespan extension. Long-chain ceramides (C24, C24:1) decreased, while medium-chain ceramides (C20, C22) increased, consistent with enhanced resistance to hypoxia and stress responses.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nCOMPARISON WITH SPACEFLIGHT DATA\n------------------------------------------------------------\nWhen compared to the CERISE ISS experiment (4-day flight), 134 differentially expressed genes overlapped, 118 of which showed consistent directional changes. These “microgravity-responsive genes” were enriched for:\n- Collagen and cuticle structural proteins\n- Locomotion and morphogenesis pathways\n- Calpain protease domains (implicated in muscle atrophy)\n\nHuman orthologs (64 genes) of these worm genes shared functions related to cytoskeletal regulation, stress response, and metabolism, underscoring cross-species conservation of microgravity effects.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nDISCUSSION\n------------------------------------------------------------\nSimulated microgravity induced transcriptomic and metabolic profiles resembling those from real spaceflight. The downregulation of sphingolipid and collagen-related genes suggests broad alterations in structural integrity, stress response, and aging pathways.\n\nKey insights include:\n- **Persistent effects:** 75% of microgravity-induced transcriptomic changes persisted after return.\n- **Longevity signaling:** Altered insulin/IGF-1 and sphingolipid pathways indicate metabolic reprogramming toward longevity adaptation.\n- **Immune and neuropeptide response:** Downregulation of defense and neuromuscular genes may explain space-induced immune suppression and motility changes.\n- **Human relevance:** Homologous gene pathways overlap with those linked to telomere maintenance and oxidative stress responses in astronauts (e.g., NASA Twins Study).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nCONCLUSIONS\n------------------------------------------------------------\n1. Simulated microgravity produces widespread and lasting transcriptomic reprogramming in *C. elegans*.\n2. Longevity-related signaling (insulin/IGF-1, sphingolipid) and structural pathways (collagen, locomotion) are significantly altered.\n3. Effects persist across generations but largely revert after 12 days on Earth.\n4. Many of these molecular signatures parallel those observed in spaceflight, validating the clinostat as a model for studying gravitational biology.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nDATA AND FUNDING\n------------------------------------------------------------\nData: GEO accession GSE122125 (NCBI).\nFunding: NASA grants NNX12AR59G, NNX10AN63H, NNX13AM08G; Sigma Xi Grant G2016100191301836.\nAcknowledgements: Supported by Delaware INBRE and EPSCoR programs; sequencing via University of Delaware Genomics Core.\n\nKeywords: *Caenorhabditis elegans*, microgravity, RNA-seq, longevity, sphingolipid signaling, ceramide, DAF-16, clinostat, space biology.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SPHINGOLIPID SIGNALING PATHWAY<|>EVENT<|>The sphingolipid signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of ceramide biosynthesis and degradation, which is linked to longevity and stress responses.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CERISE ISS EXPERIMENT<|>EVENT<|>The CERISE ISS experiment is a 4-day spaceflight study that investigates the effects of microgravity on gene expression and metabolic changes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>C.
