Philbrick, Stephen A. Martin, Amy R. Colagiovanni, Adam J. Branscum, Russell T. Turner, and Urszula T. Iwaniec\nPublished in: Journal of Endocrinology, 2018 (final edited form: 236(2):57–68)\n\n---\n\nAbstract (Summary)\nLeptin-deficient ob/ob mice exhibit mild osteopetrosis due to impaired cartilage resorption during endochondral ossification. This study investigated (1) whether the condition is self-limiting, and (2) whether it can be reversed by leptin restoration. Histological analysis of femurs from wild-type (WT) and ob/ob mice at 2, 4, and 6 months revealed persistent cartilage in ob/ob mice, showing the phenotype is not fully self-limiting. Hypothalamic leptin gene therapy using recombinant AAV (rAAV-Lep) in 2-mont...\n\n---\n\nIntroduction\nLeptin, a hormone secreted by adipose tissue, regulates energy balance and influences skeletal metabolism. ob/ob mice, lacking leptin, have reduced bone mass, shorter bones, increased marrow adiposity, and abnormal bone quality. They also display retention of cartilage within bone compartments, resembling a mild form of osteopetrosis, an illness characterized by impaired bone resorption. Osteopetrosis can be osteoclast-poor (lack of osteoclast formation) or osteoclast-rich (impaired osteoclast activity). In ob...\n\n---\n\nMaterials and Methods\n- Animals: Male WT (C57BL/6J) and leptin-deficient ob/ob mice from Jackson Labs.\n- Study 1: Histomorphometric analysis of femurs at 2, 4, and 6 months to determine cartilage persistence with age in WT and ob/ob mice.\n- Study 2: Two-month-old ob/ob mice randomized into 3 groups: untreated, rAAV-Lep, and rAAV-GFP (control). After 7 months, femoral bone/cartilage analyzed.\n- rAAV vectors: rAAV-Lep encoding rat leptin cDNA; rAAV-GFP encoding green fluorescent protein.\n- Vector delivery: Intracerebroventricular injection into the hypothalamus.\n- Tissue analyses: Histology (TRAP, Von Kossa), evaluation of cartilage, osteoclast and osteoblast perimeters.\n- Statistics: ANOVA, covariance, and nonparametric tests as needed, with FDR correction.\n\n---\n\nResults\n**Study 1 (WT vs ob/ob, effects of age):**\n- WT mice lost cartilage in all femoral compartments by 6 months.\n- ob/ob mice retained cartilage in epiphysis, metaphysis, and diaphysis even at skeletal maturity (6 months).\n- Bone bridging confirmed cessation of longitudinal growth in both genotypes, but cartilage persisted in ob/ob mice.\n- ob/ob mice had lower cancellous bone fraction and more cartilage than WT mice.\n\n**Study 2 (Hypothalamic leptin gene therapy in ob/ob mice):**\n- rAAV-Lep significantly reduced cartilage in all femoral sites (epiphysis, metaphysis, diaphysis) compared to controls.\n- rAAV-GFP had no effect, confirming leptin-specific action.\n- rAAV-Lep-treated mice showed increased osteoblast and osteoclast perimeters, indicating enhanced bone turnover.\n- Cancellous bone fraction tended to be higher in rAAV-Lep mice.\n\n---\n\nDiscussion\n- ob/ob mice exhibit a mild osteoclast-rich osteopetrosis due to impaired osteoclast activity, not formation.\n- Cartilage persistence is site-specific: cancellous sites showed age-related reduction, but diaphyseal cartilage persisted indefinitely due to lack of remodeling in cortical bone.\n- Hypothalamic leptin gene therapy enhanced bone turnover, supporting leptin’s role in coordinating osteoclast and osteoblast activity during endochondral ossification.\n- Chondrocytes express leptin receptors and may mediate cartilage remodeling via secretion of RANKL, MMPs, and HMGB1; leptin deficiency disrupts this signaling.\n- Broader systemic effects of leptin deficiency (hypogonadism, obesity, insulin resistance) may contribute, but direct skeletal actions of leptin are primary.\n- Findings confirm leptin’s role as a key regulator of cartilage resorption and skeletal maturation.\n\n---\n\nConclusion\n- The osteopetrotic phenotype in ob/ob mice is not entirely self-limiting, as cartilage persists into skeletal maturity.\n- Hypothalamic leptin gene therapy restores leptin signaling, increases bone turnover, and markedly reduces cartilage retention.\n- Osteopetrosis in leptin-deficient mice is reversible at cancellous sites, but cortical cartilage may persist due to limited turnover capacity.\n- Leptin is essential for normal skeletal growth, turnover, and replacement of cartilage with bone.\n\n---\n\nAcknowledgments\nThanks to Dr. S.P.
