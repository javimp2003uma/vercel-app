While both sexes experienced muscle loss, females preserved function better. Key interpretations include:  \n• **Hormonal influences**: Testosterone decline in males likely exacerbated atrophy, while stable estradiol levels supported female muscle maintenance.  \n• **Cellular mechanisms**: Females’ greater increase in myonuclear density may enhance their regenerative capacity.  \n• **Fiber-type differences**: Males’ type I fiber loss may explain endurance and force decline, while females’ type II loss was less impactful on function.  \n• **Comparison to other studies**: Findings align with rodent studies showing male vulnerability to disuse but differ from some human studies where women appear more affected. Species differences, protocols, and timing may explain discrepancies.  \n\nConclusion\n-----------\n• HLS caused significant muscle atrophy and functional decline in all rats.  \n• Males were more severely affected, showing greater muscle mass loss, force decline, and testosterone reduction.  \n• Females demonstrated relative resilience, maintaining strength and muscle function better, likely through hormonal and cellular adaptations.  \n• These findings underscore the importance of including both sexes in microgravity research and suggest that countermeasures may need to be sex-specific.  \n\nImplications for Spaceflight\n-----------------------------\nLong-duration missions will expose astronauts to significant unloading stress. Based on these findings:  \n• Female astronauts may retain more function but still require protection against type II fiber loss.  \n• Male astronauts may need stronger interventions to counter rapid declines in strength and testosterone-driven atrophy.  \n• Personalized countermeasure programs—considering sex, hormones, and muscle fiber type—are essential for safe human exploration of space.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
