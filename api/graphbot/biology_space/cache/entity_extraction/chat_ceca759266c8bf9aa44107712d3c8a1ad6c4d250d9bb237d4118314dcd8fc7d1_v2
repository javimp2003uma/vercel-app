Lynch, Camilla Urbaniak\nJournal: Life (MDPI), 2022, 12(4):495. DOI: 10.3390/life12040495\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nABSTRACT AND OVERVIEW\n------------------------------------------------------------\nThis comprehensive review examines how spaceflight conditions—particularly microgravity, cosmic radiation, confinement, and altered diets—affect the human microbiome and consequently astronaut health. The microbiome, a complex ecosystem of bacteria, fungi, viruses, and archaea within the human body, plays a critical role in immunity, metabolism, cognition, and overall physiological balance. Disruptions to this system (dysbiosis) during long-term missions could contribute to disease risk and impair mission s...\n\nThe review integrates evidence from human space missions (ISS, Skylab, Apollo) and analog experiments (MARS500, Lunar Palace 1) to describe changes in the microbiome at different body sites (gut, skin, nasal, oral) and the implications for immunity, nutrition, bone, and mental health. It also explores microbial adaptations to microgravity and radiation, including increased virulence, biofilm formation, and antibiotic resistance, and discusses countermeasures for maintaining astronaut health.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nTHE HUMAN MICROBIOME\n------------------------------------------------------------\nHumans host trillions of microorganisms—bacteria, fungi, archaea, and viruses—roughly equal to the number of human cells. These microbes inhabit diverse niches (gut, skin, mouth, vagina, respiratory tract) and are essential for processes such as nutrient absorption, vitamin synthesis, immune system regulation, and pathogen defense. The gut microbiome alone contains over 1000 bacterial species and millions of non-redundant genes.\n\nWhen the microbiome’s equilibrium is disturbed, diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, asthma, diabetes, and even neurological disorders can emerge. Maintaining microbial diversity and stability is vital to physiological resilience—something that becomes especially challenged in space.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nSPACEFLIGHT STRESSORS AND MICROBIOME DISRUPTION\n------------------------------------------------------------\n**1. Radiation:**  \nAstronauts in low Earth orbit (LEO) and beyond are exposed to Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR) and Solar Particle Events (SPEs), which emit highly energetic ions that penetrate spacecraft shielding. Radiation doses range from 30–120 mGy (ISS) to ~450 mGy on a Mars mission. Chronic exposure causes DNA damage, oxidative stress, and inflammation, potentially altering microbial growth and gene expression.\n\n**2. Microgravity:**  \nMicrogravity affects fluid distribution, bone and muscle density, neurovestibular balance, and immune function. It can also modify microbial physiology—altering bacterial growth rates, biofilm formation, and gene regulation.\n\n**3. Psychological Stress and Confinement:**  \nIsolation, limited privacy, altered circadian rhythms, and sleep deprivation can shift immune function and influence the gut–brain–microbiome axis. These psychosocial stressors may amplify physiological vulnerabilities during spaceflight.\n\n**4. Additional Risks:**  \nLimited access to medical care, close crew quarters, and recycling of air and water increase infection risk. Immune dysregulation and microbial adaptations under stress may enhance pathogen virulence and antibiotic resistance.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nMICROBIOME RESPONSES TO SPACEFLIGHT\n------------------------------------------------------------\nStudies across missions (ISS, Skylab, MARS500) consistently demonstrate microbiome changes during and after flight:\n\n**Gut Microbiome:**  \n- Astronaut gut microbial diversity tends to decline during flight, though composition varies.  \n- Increases in Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio and loss of beneficial taxa like *Akkermansia* are common.  \n- SCFA-producing bacteria (e.g., *Faecalibacterium prausnitzii*) decrease, potentially reducing anti-inflammatory capacity.  \n- Short missions (<1 month) still produce significant microbial shifts, which usually revert after return to Earth.  \n- Long-term missions (6–12 months) cause convergence among astronauts’ gut microbiomes—suggesting environmental homogenization aboard the ISS.\n\n**Skin, Oral, and Nasal Microbiomes:**  \n- Skin microbial diversity fluctuates; Proteobacteria often decline, while Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species increase.  \n- Saliva samples reveal temporary drops in microbial diversity and increased abundance of *Prevotella* and *Alloprevotella*, which may promote oral inflammation.  \n- Nasal microbiota show increased *Staphylococcus* and *Corynebacterium*, with changes persisting months post-flight.  \n- These shifts can heighten susceptibility to skin irritation, rhinitis, and opportunistic infections.\n\n**Environmental Exchange:**  \nMicrobial transfer between crew members and spacecraft surfaces is well documented. The spacecraft environment selects for hardy, biofilm-forming species with higher resistance to desiccation and antimicrobials.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nMICROGRAVITY AND MICROBIAL PHYSIOLOGY\n------------------------------------------------------------\nMicrogravity significantly modifies microbial behavior:  \n- Enhanced growth and mutation rates.  \n- Increased virulence and biofilm formation (e.g., *Salmonella typhimurium*, *Candida albicans*).  \n- Altered gene expression through the Hfq pathway, linked to stress response.  \n- Higher frequency of horizontal gene transfer (HGT), accelerating antibiotic resistance gene spread.  \n- Microbes isolated from the ISS often carry more mobile genetic elements than Earth-based equivalents.  \n\nThese findings suggest that in the space environment, pathogenic traits can become amplified while antibiotic efficacy may decrease. Overprescription or contamination events could rapidly propagate resistant strains in confined habitats.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
