Doh, Chandran R. Sabanayagam\nJournal: *Cells* (2023), 12, 270. DOI: 10.3390/cells12020270\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nABSTRACT\n------------------------------------------------------------\nThis study explores how simulated microgravity influences gene expression in *Caenorhabditis elegans* (C. elegans) and compares these findings with previous spaceflight experiments. Using RNA-sequencing and mass spectrometry, the authors found that simulated microgravity induces extensive changes in gene expression — notably in longevity-related pathways like insulin/IGF-1 and sphingolipid signaling. Roughly 75% of gene expression changes persisted for four days after the worms’ return to normal gravity, but most were reversed by twelve days. Moreover, 118 genes were shared between simulated microgravity and real spaceflight conditions, suggesting a conserved “microgravity-responsive” transcriptomic signature.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nINTRODUCTION\n------------------------------------------------------------\nSpaceflight exposes organisms to microgravity and radiation, both of which disrupt physiology. *C. elegans* is a powerful model organism for studying these effects due to its short lifespan, well-mapped genetics, and physiological similarity to humans. Previous space missions (ICE-First, CERISE, Shenzhou-8, etc.) have demonstrated major changes in metabolism, reproduction, and neuromuscular function. However, most used liquid culture systems that may introduce stress unrelated to microgravity. This study aims to isolate the specific effects of simulated microgravity using clinostat rotation, a ground-based system that continuously rotates samples to average the gravitational vector.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nMETHODS\n------------------------------------------------------------\n**Organism and Conditions:** Wild-type *C. elegans* (strain N2) were grown in CeHR axenic liquid medium at 21°C. After a three-week acclimation period, worms were subjected to clinostat rotation (1 rad/s, ~10 RPM) for four days—representing exposure to simulated microgravity.\n\n**Experimental Groups:**\n- **MG:** Worms exposed to microgravity for 4 days.\n- **R1-GC:** Returned to normal gravity for 4 days.\n- **R2-GC:** Returned for 8 days.\n- **R3-GC:** Returned for 12 days.\n\n**Analysis Techniques:**\n- RNA-seq performed using Illumina HiSeq 2500.\n- Gene expression analyzed via Tuxedo pipeline and DESeq2, with FDR < 0.05 and log2FC > 2.\n- Functional enrichment via DAVID, KEGG, and WormBase tools.\n- Lipid quantification performed by LC/MS/MS to measure ceramide and sphingolipid levels.\n- Comparison with prior spaceflight data (CERISE) from NASA GeneLab.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRESULTS\n------------------------------------------------------------\n**1. Broad Gene Expression Changes:**\nHundreds of genes were differentially expressed in simulated microgravity. After returning to ground conditions, 75% of these differences persisted for four days, 16% after twelve days. Downregulated genes were primarily in neuronal, epithelial, and intestinal tissues; upregulated genes were enriched in reproductive tissues.\n\n**2. Sustained Gene Expression Effects:**\nEven after 12 days in normal gravity (three worm generations), transcriptomic profiles remained distinct from controls, showing long-lasting effects of simulated microgravity.\n\n**3. Biological Processes Affected:**\n- Upregulated pathways: Dorso-ventral axis formation, reproduction, chitin metabolism.\n- Downregulated pathways: Lysosome function, cuticle development, defense response, and locomotion.\nNeuropeptide signaling genes (flp, nlp families) were notably downregulated, implying neuromuscular and behavioral impacts.\n\n**4. Noncoding RNAs and Transcription Factors:**\nSimulated microgravity triggered changes in noncoding RNAs, with 126 ncRNAs induced and 16 silenced. Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) and long noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) were particularly responsive. Twenty transcription factors (e.g., tbx-43, daf-16 targets) were upregulated, many maintaining their activity for over a week post-return.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nLONGEVITY-RELATED PATHWAYS\n------------------------------------------------------------\nMicrogravity altered genes involved in the insulin/IGF-1 and DAF-16/FOXO signaling pathways, both central to longevity regulation in *C. elegans*.\n\n- 11 genes in the KEGG “Longevity Regulating Pathway” were differentially expressed.\n- Downregulated genes included sod-3, ctl-1, and lips-17 — typically DAF-16 targets associated with stress resistance and lifespan extension.\n- Despite these downstream effects, DAF-16 and pqm-1 transcripts were unchanged, suggesting post-translational regulation (e.g., nuclear translocation).\n\nStatistical enrichment showed that 144 DAF-16–induced genes were downregulated, indicating that simulated microgravity broadly suppresses the DAF-16 longevity network. These data imply that altered stress response and metabolic signaling contribute to potential lifespan modulation in space conditions.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nSPHINGOLIPID SIGNALING AND CERAMIDE METABOLISM\n------------------------------------------------------------\nThe sphingolipid signaling pathway was strongly suppressed. Key enzymes—*gba-4* and *asm-3*—were downregulated, reducing ceramide biosynthesis and degradation. LC/MS/MS data confirmed metabolic shifts:\n- Total ceramide ↓ 1.5×\n- Hexosylceramide ↓ 3.6×\n- Sphingosine\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CAENORHABDITIS ELEGANS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Caenorhabditis elegans, commonly known as C. elegans, is a model organism used in biological research, particularly in studies related to genetics and developmental biology, and is the focus of this study on microgravity effects.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IREM ÇELEN<|>PERSON<|>İrem Çelen is one of the authors of the study exploring the effects of simulated microgravity on C. elegans.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AROSHAN JAYASINGHE<|>PERSON<|>Aroshan Jayasinghe is a co-author of the study on the transcriptomic signature of C. elegans in response to simulated microgravity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JUNG H.
