These factors simulate two major hazards astronauts face during spaceflight: mechanical unloading and cosmic radiation. The study focuses on knee and hip cartilage integrity, using imaging, histology, serum biomarkers, and proteomics.\n\nBackground\n-----------\n• Healthy joint cartilage relies on mechanical loading for structural integrity and maintenance.  \n• Spaceflight reduces weight-bearing, leading to cartilage thinning, degradation, and early arthritic changes.  \n• Radiation is an additional hazard: clinical studies show cartilage degeneration after therapeutic radiation; preclinical work indicates even low-dose exposure can induce osteoarthritic phenotypes.  \n• However, the combined effects of unloading and low-dose radiation (<1 Gy) had not been studied together before this work.  \n\nMethods\n--------\n• **Animals**: 80 female C57BL/6 mice (16 weeks old), divided into 8 groups (10 mice/group).  \n• **Conditions**:  \n  - Ground-sham (control).  \n  - Ground irradiated with 0.1, 0.5, or 1.0 Gy.  \n  - HLU (hindlimb unloading) sham.  \n  - HLU irradiated with 0.1, 0.5, or 1.0 Gy.  \n• **Procedures**:  \n  - HLU simulated microgravity for 30 days.  \n  - Irradiation performed on day 6 using 10 MV X-ray photons.  \n  - At day 30, serum, hindlimbs, and hip cartilage were collected.  \n• **Analyses**:  \n  - Contrast-enhanced micro-CT for cartilage volume and thickness.  \n  - Histology and immunostaining for collagen and MMP-13.  \n  - Serum cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (sCOMP) as a biomarker of cartilage turnover.  \n  - Proteomics of femoral head cartilage with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) for signaling pathways.  \n\nResults\n--------\n1. **Cartilage volume and thickness**  \n   - Radiation significantly reduced cartilage volume, with decreases of 20–27% compared to controls.  \n   - HLU also reduced cartilage volume (~19%).  \n   - Thickness at the main load-bearing tibial-femoral contact point was significantly reduced in all irradiated and/or HLU groups.  \n\n2. **Collagen and histology**  \n   - Collagen content in tibial plateau cartilage decreased across all treatment groups.  \n   - Greatest reductions occurred at 0.1 Gy radiation (–81% in ground mice).  \n   - HLU alone reduced collagen by ~73%.  \n   - MMP-13, a cartilage-degrading enzyme, was elevated in HLU and irradiated groups, indicating active catabolic remodeling.  \n   - Despite biochemical evidence of damage, OARSI scoring showed no overt cartilage surface erosion at 30 days.  \n\n3. **Serum biomarkers (sCOMP)**  \n   - Irradiated groups had significantly higher serum COMP, consistent with ongoing cartilage degradation.  \n   - Increases occurred regardless of loading condition, highlighting radiation’s independent role.  \n\n4. **Proteomic findings**  \n   - Mass spectrometry revealed reductions in multiple cartilage matrix proteins (aggrecan, hyaluronan link proteoglycan, chondroadherin, SPARC, lumican, vimentin).  \n   - These decreases point to compromised extracellular matrix stability and impaired chondrocyte function.  \n   - Pathway analysis showed suppression of osteoarthritis, oxidative stress (NRF2), unfolded protein response (UPR), and mTOR signaling, suggesting early degenerative signaling.  \n   - Evidence of oxidative stress (increased S100A6) and chondrocyte apoptosis (reduced CPNY2) was observed.  \n\nDiscussion\n-----------\n• Both HLU and low-dose radiation induced significant cartilage degradation and early arthritic phenotypes.  \n• Radiation, even at very low doses (0.1 Gy), triggered measurable catabolic changes, challenging assumptions that cartilage is “radiation-resistant.”  \n• The most severe changes occurred at the tibial-femoral contact point, the site of greatest biomechanical loading.  \n• Elevated serum COMP indicates systemic markers of joint damage appear early, which could be used for astronaut monitoring.  \n• Combined effects were not statistically additive, but both stressors independently impaired cartilage health.  \n• Findings align with prior rodent studies and clinical evidence that unloading and radiation both accelerate cartilage degeneration.  \n\nLimitations\n------------\n• Small sample size in proteomics required pooling, limiting statistical power.  \n• Short study duration (30 days) may underestimate long-term degenerative effects.  \n• Radiation model used acute X-ray exposure, not fully representative of chronic HZE cosmic radiation encountered in space.  \n• Further studies with mixed radiation beams, longer duration, and recovery analysis are needed.  \n\nConclusion\n-----------\nThis study shows that both unloading and low-dose radiation (<1 Gy) independently damage joint cartilage, reducing volume, thickness, collagen, and matrix proteins, while elevating cartilage degradation biomarkers. These findings suggest astronauts are at risk of early-onset cartilage degeneration and arthritis from prolonged spaceflight. Countermeasures must address both reduced mechanical loading and radiation exposure to preserve joint health during long missions.\n\nImplications for Spaceflight\n-----------------------------\n• Joint cartilage is more sensitive to unloading and low-dose radiation than previously thought.  \n• Long-duration missions\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>KNEE AND HIP JOINT CARTILAGE DAMAGE<|>EVENT<|>A study investigating the effects of reduced weight-bearing and low-dose radiation on joint cartilage in mice, simulating hazards faced by astronauts during spaceflight.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>C57BL/6 MICE<|>PERSON<|>A strain of female mice used in the study to assess the impact of hindlimb unloading and radiation on cartilage health.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HINDLIMB UNLOADING (HLU)<|>EVENT<|>A condition simulating microgravity by reducing weight-bearing, which was part of the study's experimental design.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RADIATION<|>EVENT<|>Low-dose radiation exposure (<1 Gy) that was tested in the study to evaluate its effects on cartilage integrity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARTILAGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tissue that provides support and cushioning in joints, which was the focus of the study regarding its degradation due to spaceflight hazards.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NASA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The U.S. government agency responsible for the nation's civilian space program and for aeronautics and aerospace research, relevant to the implications of the study for astronauts.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HINDLIMB UNLOADING (HLU)<|>CARTILAGE<|>Hindlimb unloading was shown to reduce cartilage volume and thickness, indicating a direct impact on cartilage health<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RADIATION<|>CARTILAGE<|>Radiation exposure was found to significantly reduce cartilage volume and induce catabolic changes, demonstrating its harmful effects<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>C57BL/6 MICE<|>HINDLIMB UNLOADING (HLU)<|>C57BL/6 mice were used to study the effects of hindlimb unloading on cartilage<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>C57BL/6 MICE<|>RADIATION<|>C57BL/6 mice were exposed to radiation to assess its impact on cartilage health<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NASA<|>KNEE AND HIP JOINT CARTILAGE DAMAGE<|>The study's findings have implications for NASA's understanding of astronaut health during long-duration space missions<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
