Using both actual spaceflight (ISS, Shuttle) and ground-based HLU models, the researchers demonstrate that unloading leads to cartilage thinning, meniscal degradation, biochemical catabolism, and molecular features resembling early osteoarthritis (OA). Exercise during recovery promotes joint tissue restoration.\n\nBackground\n-----------\n• Osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of disability, driven by complex interactions between risk factors (age, sex, obesity, genetics) and abnormal joint loading.  \n• Both excessive and insufficient mechanical loading degrade cartilage and menisci, leading to OA.  \n• Spaceflight and HLU offer unique models to study unloading-induced joint degeneration.  \n• Prior studies showed unloading reduces glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content and increases cartilage-degrading enzymes, but meniscal responses were less understood.  \n\nMethods\n--------\n• **Rodent Research-9 (RR9, ISS mission)**: Male C57BL/6 mice, ~35 days in orbit.  \n• **STS-135 Shuttle mission**: Female C57BL/6 mice, 13 days in orbit.  \n• **HLU model**: Male mice, 30 days HLU, followed by 49 days of reloading with/without climbing or running exercise.  \n• **Assessments**:  \n  - MicroCT for cartilage/meniscus volume and thickness.  \n  - Histology for GAG content (Safranin-O).  \n  - Immunostaining for MMP-13, ADAMTS5.  \n  - Proteomics (LC-MS/MS) of menisci + pathway analysis (IPA).  \n\nResults\n--------\n1. **Cartilage changes**  \n   - ISS mice: ~25% thinning at tibial-femoral contact point; 15% volume loss.  \n   - HLU mice: ~29% thinning and ~18% volume loss at contact point.  \n   - Shuttle mice: early GAG loss despite continued skeletal growth.  \n\n2. **Meniscus changes**  \n   - ISS: 9.5% volume decline; ~23–28% lower GAG content.  \n   - Shuttle: 11% lower GAG in medial/lateral menisci after 13 days.  \n   - HLU: ~72% GAG loss in meniscus; volume decline ~8%.  \n\n3. **Biochemical & molecular responses**  \n   - Elevated **MMP-13** and **ADAMTS5** in cartilage and menisci post-flight/HLU.  \n   - Proteomics of ISS menisci: 292 proteins altered. Pathways included mitochondrial dysfunction, reduced mTOR/AKT signaling, suppressed EIF2, and impaired NRF2-mediated oxidative stress defenses.  \n   - Evidence of apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3), oxidative stress, and reduced anabolic signaling.  \n\n4. **Exercise recovery (HLU readaptation)**  \n   - Running exercise restored cartilage thickness and volume after unloading.  \n   - Climbing partially improved cartilage; no exercise led to persistent thinning.  \n   - Meniscal volume recovered in HLU groups with exercise, especially running.  \n\nDiscussion\n-----------\n• Unloading via spaceflight or HLU induces early arthritic changes in cartilage and menisci.  \n• Damage localizes at tibial-femoral contact points, the highest mechanical load regions.  \n• Menisci are highly sensitive to unloading, showing oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and catabolic enzyme activation.  \n• Spaceflight-induced molecular signatures resemble osteoarthritis and oxidative stress models.  \n• Running exercise during reloading promoted recovery, suggesting mechanical re-stimulation preserves joint health.  \n\nConclusion\n-----------\nReduced weight-bearing from spaceflight or HLU induces cartilage and meniscus degradation, molecular oxidative stress, and OA-like catabolism. However, exercise (especially running) during reloading promotes recovery. These findings emphasize the importance of prescribed exercise countermeasures for astronauts and for patients with unloading-related conditions on Earth.\n\nImplications for Spaceflight and Medicine\n------------------------------------------\n• Astronauts face risks of joint degeneration during prolonged missions, with cartilage and menisci showing early OA features.  \n• Meniscal thinning may predispose to joint injury upon return to gravity or during surface operations (e.g., on Mars).  \n• Monitoring biomarkers (MMPs, oxidative stress proteins) could enable early detection.  \n• Countermeasures: resistive exercise (running analogs), oxidative stress modulation, targeting mTOR/NRF2 pathways.  \n• Clinically, these findings support exercise therapy as a recovery tool for patients with reduced weight-bearing from injury or immobility.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SPACEFLIGHT<|>EVENT<|>Spaceflight refers to the act of traveling into or through outer space, which in this study is linked to the effects of reduced weight-bearing on knee joint cartilage and menisci in rodents.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HINDLIMB UNLOADING<|>EVENT<|>Hindlimb unloading (HLU) is a method used to simulate the effects of microgravity on biological systems, particularly in this study to assess its impact on knee joint health in rodents.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RODENT RESEARCH-9<|>EVENT<|>Rodent Research-9 (RR9) is an ISS mission involving male C57BL/6 mice that were studied for 35 days in orbit to observe the effects of spaceflight on knee joint cartilage.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STS-135 SHUTTLE MISSION<|>EVENT<|>STS-135 was a space shuttle mission that included female C57BL/6 mice for 13 days in orbit, used to study the effects of spaceflight on cartilage and menisci.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>C57BL/6 MICE<|>PERSON<|>C57BL/6 mice are a specific strain of laboratory mice used in this study to investigate the effects of spaceflight and hindlimb unloading on knee joint health.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OSTEOARTHRITIS<|>EVENT<|>Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease characterized by cartilage degradation, which is a focus of this study in relation to the effects of unloading.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MMP-13<|>PERSON<|>MMP-13 is a matrix metalloproteinase enzyme that is elevated in cartilage and menisci post-flight or hindlimb unloading, indicating its role in joint degradation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ADAMTS5<|>PERSON<|>ADAMTS5 is an aggrecanase enzyme involved in cartilage degradation, which was found to be elevated in the study's findings related to spaceflight and unloading.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPACEFLIGHT<|>HINDLIMB UNLOADING<|>Both spaceflight and hindlimb unloading are methods used to study the effects of reduced weight-bearing on joint health in rodents<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RODENT RESEARCH-9<|>SPACEFLIGHT<|>Rodent Research-9 is an ISS mission that investigates the effects of spaceflight on knee joint cartilage<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STS-135 SHUTTLE MISSION<|>SPACEFLIGHT<|>STS-135 is a space shuttle mission that studies the effects of spaceflight on knee joint health<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>C57BL/6 MICE<|>RODENT RESEARCH-9<|>C57BL/6 mice are the subjects used in the Rodent Research-9 study to assess the impact of spaceflight<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>C57BL/6 MICE<|>STS-135 SHUTTLE MISSION<|>C57BL/6 mice were also used in the STS-135 mission to study the effects of spaceflight on cartilage<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OSTEOARTHRITIS<|>HINDLIMB UNLOADING<|>The study investigates how hindlimb unloading induces changes that resemble osteoarthritis in knee joint cartilage<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MMP-13<|>OSTEOARTHRITIS<|>MMP-13 is elevated in the context of osteoarthritis and is studied in relation to the effects of unloading<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ADAMTS5<|>OSTEOARTHRITIS<|>ADAMTS5 is involved in cartilage degradation and is relevant to the study of osteoarthritis<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
