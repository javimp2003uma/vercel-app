Mice flown on the Space Shuttle Atlantis (STS-135) for 13.5 days showed significant alterations in oxidative defense, autophagy, proteasome activation, and senescence pathways. The results highlight the vulnerability of the liver, a mitochondria-rich organ, to oxidative stress during spaceflight.\n\nBackground\n-----------\n• Spaceflight stressors (microgravity, low-dose radiation, psychological/environmental stress, microbial exposure) increase reactive oxygen species (ROS).  \n• ROS damage DNA, proteins, and lipids, leading to apoptosis, senescence, and inflammation.  \n• Astronauts often show impaired glucose regulation and signs of metabolic stress.  \n• Previous work found decreased hepatic glutathione and increased markers of oxidative damage in spaceflown mice. This study expands the analysis using whole metabolomic and transcriptomic datasets.  \n\nMethods\n--------\n• **Animals**: Female C57BL/6J mice (9 weeks old, n=15/group), flown for 13.5 days or housed as ground controls in matched Animal Enclosure Modules (AEMs).  \n• **Samples**: Liver tissues collected within 3–5 h of shuttle landing.  \n• **Analyses**:  \n  - Metabolomics (LC/MS, GC/MS) for small molecule profiling.  \n  - Transcriptomics (Affymetrix GeneChip arrays).  \n  - Integrated pathway enrichment using MetaboAnalyst, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), and Exploratory Gene Association Networks (EGAN).  \n  - Histology for lipid accumulation and inflammation.  \n\nResults\n--------\n1. **Metabolite changes**  \n   - Significant separation between flight (FLT) and ground (AEM) mice.  \n   - Increased: 3-hydroxybutyrate, glutarate, propionylcarnitine, ophthalmate (marker of GSH depletion).  \n   - Decreased: glutathione, glycerophosphorylcholine, cystathionine.  \n   - Patterns suggest impaired glutathione metabolism, oxidative stress, and dehydration.  \n   - Osmolytes betaine and taurine were elevated, linked to water intake reduction (~20%).  \n\n2. **Histology**  \n   - FLT mice had increased lipid droplets (steatosis) and infiltration of inflammatory cells.  \n   - Suggests impaired membrane metabolism and inflammation.  \n\n3. **Transcriptomics**  \n   - ~3000 genes significantly altered; 601 biologically relevant (449 up, 152 down).  \n   - Upregulated: genes for metabolism, DNA repair, autophagy (Atg2a, LC3, Wipi1/2), proteasome subunits, peroxisomal genes.  \n   - Downregulated: NRF2 pathway (oxidative defense), immune regulation, lipid metabolism.  \n   - Cell cycle regulators indicated senescence induction (↑ CDKN1a/p21, INK4C/p18).  \n\n4. **Integrated analysis**  \n   - Enriched pathways: glycerophospholipid/sphingolipid metabolism, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, purine metabolism, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis.  \n   - Evidence for mitochondrial dysfunction and defective tRNA modification.  \n   - Autophagy and proteasome activation consistent with attempts to degrade oxidized proteins.  \n   - NRF2 oxidative defense downregulated, exacerbating oxidative damage.  \n\n5. **Senescence and mitochondrial dysfunction**  \n   - Data suggest hepatocyte senescence driven by oxidative stress, protein aggregation, and impaired clearance.  \n   - Upregulation of p21 and p38 MAPK links to mitochondrial dysfunction and lipid accumulation.  \n   - Phenotype resembles aging and obesity-related liver disease.  \n\nDiscussion\n-----------\n• Short-term spaceflight (13.5 days) significantly altered liver metabolism.  \n• Impaired oxidative defense and NRF2 downregulation promote ROS damage.  \n• Activation of autophagy and proteasome indicates cellular attempts to maintain homeostasis, but persistent stress may induce senescence.  \n• Choline depletion and altered osmolyte balance reflect dehydration and disrupted lipid metabolism.  \n• Liver steatosis and inflammation parallel astronaut observations of metabolic stress.  \n\nConclusion\n-----------\n• Spaceflight induces oxidative stress, impaired antioxidant defense, autophagy, proteasome activation, and senescence in mouse liver.  \n• Mitochondrial dysfunction and altered membrane metabolism suggest vulnerability to chronic liver damage.  \n• Findings provide insight into spaceflight-induced metabolic disorders and potential risks of liver disease in astronauts.  \n\nImplications for Spaceflight\n-----------------------------\n• Long-duration missions may accelerate liver aging, steatosis, and metabolic dysfunction.  \n• Monitoring hepatic biomarkers (glutathione, ophthalmate, serum lipids) may aid astronaut health surveillance.  \n• Countermeasures: antioxidants, NRF2 activators, hydration strategies, and therapies targeting autophagy/proteasome balance.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SPACEFLIGHT<|>EVENT<|>Spaceflight refers to the act of traveling into or through outer space, which in this study impacts liver metabolism and stress responses in mice.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOUSE<|>PERSON<|>Mice are the subjects of the study, specifically female C57BL/6J mice, used to analyze the effects of spaceflight on liver metabolism.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPACE SHUTTLE ATLANTIS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Space Shuttle Atlantis was used for the STS-135 mission, which involved the mice being flown for 13.5 days.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NASA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>NASA is the U.S. government agency responsible for the nation's civilian space program and for aeronautics and aerospace research, overseeing missions like STS-135.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIVER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The liver is a vital organ in the body that is affected by oxidative stress and metabolic changes during spaceflight.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OXIDATIVE STRESS<|>EVENT<|>Oxidative stress refers to the damage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can lead to various health issues, including liver damage.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUTOPHAGY<|>EVENT<|>Autophagy is a cellular process that degrades and recycles cellular components, which is activated in response to stress during spaceflight.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROTEASOME<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The proteasome is a protein complex that degrades unneeded or damaged proteins, which is activated in the liver during spaceflight.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GLUTATHIONE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Glutathione is an antioxidant that is significantly altered in the liver of mice flown in space, indicating oxidative stress.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEPATOCYTE<|>PERSON<|>Hepatocytes are the main functional cells of the liver, which are affected by oxidative stress and metabolic changes during spaceflight.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPACEFLIGHT<|>MOUSE<|>The study examines how spaceflight impacts the health and metabolism of mice, specifically their liver function<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPACE SHUTTLE ATLANTIS<|>SPACEFLIGHT<|>The Space Shuttle Atlantis was the vehicle used for the spaceflight that the study is based on<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NASA<|>SPACE SHUTTLE ATLANTIS<|>NASA is the organization that operated the Space Shuttle Atlantis for the STS-135 mission<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LIVER<|>MOUSE<|>The liver of the mice is the focus of the study, examining how it responds to the conditions of spaceflight<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OXIDATIVE STRESS<|>LIVER<|>Oxidative stress is a condition that significantly affects liver metabolism and health during spaceflight<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUTOPHAGY<|>LIVER<|>Autophagy is activated in the liver as a response to the stressors experienced during spaceflight<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROTEASOME<|>LIVER<|>The proteasome is activated in the liver to help manage damaged proteins due to oxidative stress during spaceflight<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GLUTATHIONE<|>LIVER<|>Glutathione levels are altered in the liver of mice flown in space, indicating oxidative stress<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HEPATOCYTE<|>OXIDATIVE STRESS<|>Hepatocytes experience oxidative stress during spaceflight, leading to potential damage and metabolic changes<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
