Using comparative transcriptomic analyses, the study identifies shared and distinct molecular responses between muscle types and across species, highlighting the potential of invertebrate data to augment mammalian findings where spaceflight studies are limited.\n\nBackground\n-----------\n• Spaceflight induces skeletal muscle atrophy, especially in antigravity muscles (e.g., soleus).  \n• Microgravity shifts muscle fibers from type I (slow-twitch) to type II (fast-twitch).  \n• NASA’s GeneLab provides omics datasets for spaceflown organisms, but experiments are resource-limited.  \n• Invertebrates, due to simplicity and ease of large-scale studies, may complement rodent models for mechanistic insights.  \n\nObjectives\n-----------\n1. Compare transcriptomic responses of slow-twitch soleus and fast-twitch EDL from spaceflown mice (Rodent Research-1).  \n2. Compare mouse data with C. elegans and Drosophila datasets from past spaceflight missions.  \n3. Relate findings to ground-based analogs (hindlimb unloading, bedrest).  \n4. Identify conserved pathways and evaluate invertebrate utility for anticipating mammalian responses.  \n\nMethods\n--------\n• Transcriptomic datasets from NASA GeneLab and GEO were used.  \n• RNA-seq for mouse soleus, EDL, quadriceps; microarray for mouse gastrocnemius, human bedrest vastus lateralis, C. elegans, and Drosophila larvae/adults.  \n• Differential expression analysis (DEA), Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), and overrepresentation analysis (ORA) were applied.  \n• Cross-species comparisons employed orthology mapping.  \n\nResults\n--------\n1. **Mouse muscle responses**  \n   - Soleus showed the most atrophy and transcriptomic changes (↓ metabolism, ↑ stress responses).  \n   - EDL showed proliferative and immune signatures, with resistance to atrophy (↑ Pgc1α, ↓ PDE2a → ↑ cAMP signaling).  \n   - Circadian rhythm genes were disrupted in both muscles, implicating stress and sleep regulation.  \n   - Gastrocnemius (spaceflight vs. HU) showed overlap in circadian and stress pathways but also differences in energy metabolism.  \n   - Quadriceps (mice) vs. human bedrest vastus lateralis revealed shared regulation of glucose metabolism and ubiquitin ligases (e.g., Fbxo40).  \n\n2. **C. elegans comparisons**  \n   - Shared signatures with EDL: ↑ proliferation-related genes, ↓ PDE genes (↑ cAMP).  \n   - Shared with soleus: mitochondrial DNA repair and metabolism genes, but opposite regulation for immune and adhesion genes.  \n   - Suggests nematodes better model fast-twitch resistance to atrophy.  \n\n3. **Drosophila comparisons**  \n   - **Larvae**: Shared stress and protein metabolism regulation with EDL and soleus; UPR downregulated (similar to soleus).  \n   - **Adults**: Shared circadian and stress responses with EDL; metabolism shifted toward amino acid and fatty acid pathways.  \n   - Life stage strongly influenced transcriptomic similarity to mammalian muscles.  \n\n4. **Shared features across models**  \n   - ECM remodeling consistently altered: rodents/humans upregulated ECM genes, while invertebrates downregulated them.  \n   - Stress and glucocorticoid signaling universally perturbed.  \n   - Circadian rhythm consistently disrupted, linking to metabolism and atrophy.  \n\nDiscussion\n-----------\n• Fast- and slow-twitch muscles differ in vulnerability: soleus is highly atrophy-prone; EDL engages compensatory proliferation and immune responses.  \n• cAMP signaling, PDE regulation, and non-coding RNAs may underlie atrophy resistance in EDL and potentially in C. elegans.  \n• Glucocorticoid stress and circadian rhythm disruption are key cross-species hallmarks of spaceflight.  \n• Invertebrates, while lacking adaptive immunity, capture conserved stress, metabolism, and circadian responses.  \n• Life stage in Drosophila critically shapes relevance to mammalian muscle.  \n\nImplications for Spaceflight\n-----------------------------\n• Countermeasures should account for differences between fast- and slow-twitch muscle responses.  \n• Conserved targets: cAMP signaling, glucocorticoid/circadian regulation, ECM remodeling.  \n• Invertebrates provide scalable, cost-effective models to screen pathways and interventions before mammalian studies.  \n• Integration of rodent, human, and invertebrate omics will maximize insights from limited spaceflight opportunities.  \n\nConclusion\n-----------\nMammalian and invertebrate models reveal both shared and unique molecular responses to spaceflight. While rodents remain the gold standard for human analogs, invertebrates offer complementary insights, especially into conserved stress, metabolic, and circadian pathways. Combining these models enhances mechanistic understanding and supports the design of targeted countermeasures against muscle atrophy in space and on Earth.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
