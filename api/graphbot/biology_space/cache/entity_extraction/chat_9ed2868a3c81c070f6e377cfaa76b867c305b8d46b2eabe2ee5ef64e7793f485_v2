This study examined how 37 days of microgravity affected bone in young adult female C57BL/6J mice. The major finding was that bone loss occurred specifically at weight-bearing skeletal sites (femur), while non-weight-bearing sites (lumbar vertebrae) showed little or no effect. The results suggest microgravity-induced mechanical unloading, rather than systemic stressors or radiation, is the primary cause of bone loss. Additionally, microgravity accelerated femoral head ossification, indicating premature skeletal maturation.\n\n---\n\nIntroduction\nBone health is a key concern for long-duration spaceflight. Previous studies in rodents and humans show variable site-specific bone loss, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study tested the hypothesis that mechanical unloading in microgravity leads to localized bone loss at weight-bearing skeletal sites, rather than systemic effects such as space radiation. The femur was chosen as the main site of interest due to its role in weight-bearing, while the L2 vertebra was chosen as a non-weight-bearing comparison.\n\n---\n\nMethods\n- Animal Model: Female C57BL/6J mice, 16 weeks old at launch, housed in NASAâ€™s Rodent Research Habitat (RH) on the ISS for 37 days.\n- Groups: Spaceflight (FL), ground control in RH (GC), standard vivarium housing (VIV), and baseline controls (BL).\n- Sample Collection: Bones collected and analyzed using microcomputed tomography (ÂµCT) and histology.\n- Sites Analyzed: Femoral head, femoral neck, femoral midshaft, distal femoral epiphysis, and L2 vertebra.\n- Measurements: Trabecular and cortical parameters (BV/TV, trabecular thickness, separation, connectivity, cortical thickness, etc.).\n- Statistics: ANOVA, t-tests, and paired comparisons between sites.\n\n---\n\nResults\n1. **Femoral Head (cancellous bone):**\n   - Significant bone loss in spaceflight compared to all controls.\n   - Decreased trabecular number and thickness, increased separation and pattern factor.\n   - Suggests strong atrophy after 37 days of microgravity.\n\n2. **Distal Femoral Epiphysis:**\n   - Major bone loss in both VIV and FL groups compared to GC.\n   - Loss of trabecular number and connectivity density in FL mice.\n   - RH housing mitigated some bone loss compared to vivarium housing.\n\n3. **Femoral Neck and Midshaft (cortical bone):**\n   - Spaceflight reduced cortical bone area and thickness compared to controls.\n   - Enlarged marrow cavity in the femoral neck after spaceflight.\n   - Suggests cortical erosion in weight-bearing bones.\n\n4. **L2 Vertebrae:**\n   - No statistically significant changes across groups.\n   - Indicates non-weight-bearing sites are resistant to microgravity bone loss.\n\n5. **Comparisons Across Sites:**\n   - Paired analyses showed strong, consistent bone loss in femoral regions but not in vertebrae.\n   - Supports weight-bearing unloading as the main driver of degeneration.\n\n6. **Secondary Endochondral Ossification (SEO):**\n   - Accelerated in femoral head during spaceflight.\n   - Microgravity promoted premature ossification compared to aging or ground controls.\n   - Suggests early skeletal maturation linked to mechanical unloading.\n\n---\n\nDiscussion\n- Bone loss in microgravity is site-specific and localized to weight-bearing skeletal regions (femur).\n- The lack of vertebral bone loss implies systemic factors (radiation, oxidative stress, hormonal effects) are less important in this context.\n- Radiation dose on the ISS (7.4 mGy over 37 days) was far too low to account for observed bone changes.\n- Housing type also played a role: RH controls retained healthier bone compared to standard vivarium controls, likely due to increased mechanical stimulation in enriched environments.\n- Accelerated ossification in the femoral head is a novel finding, suggesting premature closure of growth plates in microgravity, which may impact skeletal development in young organisms.\n\n---\n\nConclusion\n- Mechanical unloading in microgravity is the main effector of bone loss in weight-bearing skeletal sites of female C57BL/6J mice.\n- Space radiation and systemic stress factors did not significantly contribute within the 37-day timeframe in Low Earth Orbit.\n- Accelerated secondary ossification may indicate a risk of premature skeletal maturation during long-duration spaceflight.\n- Rodent Habitat housing provided partial protection against bone loss compared to vivarium housing.\n- These findings have important implications for human spaceflight, particularly regarding fracture risk, bone health, and developmental biology in microgravity environments.\n\n---\n\nAcknowledgments\nSupported by NASA Space Biology programs and research teams from NASA Ames, Blue Marble Institute, and collaborating universities.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
