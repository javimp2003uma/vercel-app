DOI: 10.3390/ijms241713569\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nABSTRACT SUMMARY\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis study investigates how exposure to the spaceflight environment affects gene expression in specific regions of the mouse brain and whether the antioxidant MnTnBuOE-2-PyP5+ (BuOE) can mitigate these effects. Mice were exposed to 35 days of microgravity aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Using high-resolution digital spatial profiling (DSP), the researchers analyzed four brain regions—the Cortex (CT), Frontal Cortex (FCT), Cornu Ammonis 1 (CA1), and Dentate Gyrus (DG). They found that spaceflight caused substantial gene expression alterations related to oxidative stress, metabolism, apoptosis, and neuroinflammation. Importantly, BuOE treatment reduced or reversed many of these changes, suggesting its potential to mitigate CNS oxidative damage caused by spaceflight conditions.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nINTRODUCTION\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nSpaceflight introduces unique physiological stressors, including cosmic radiation, microgravity, and isolation, which collectively affect multiple organ systems. The central nervous system (CNS) is particularly sensitive to these stressors, and previous animal studies have shown behavioral and cognitive impairments after radiation or simulated microgravity exposure. Long-duration missions to deep space may therefore increase the risk of neurodegenerative diseases or cognitive decline in astronauts.\n\nPrevious research has documented protein and metabolic alterations in the mouse brain after spaceflight, with specific changes differing across regions such as grey and white matter. However, regional transcriptomic responses remain poorly understood. This study focuses on understanding how specific brain areas—especially those involved in cognition, memory, and emotional regulation—respond to spaceflight stress and whether antioxidant intervention can counteract the effects.\n\nThe cortex (CT) and frontal cortex (FCT) are crucial for motor coordination, attention, memory, and behavior, while the hippocampus—comprising the CA1 and DG regions—is essential for learning, spatial memory, and neurogenesis. Evidence indicates that microgravity and radiation can negatively influence these regions, leading to structural and functional impairments.\n\nOxidative stress is one of the primary mechanisms of spaceflight-induced cellular damage. BuOE, a superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimic, has demonstrated potent antioxidant and neuroprotective properties in previous radiation injury models. The study hypothesizes that BuOE may protect neural tissue by reducing oxidative gene expression changes induced by spaceflight.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nMETHODS\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nAnimal Model and Spaceflight Conditions:\n- Male C57BL/6 mice (10 weeks old) were used.\n- Mice spent 35 days aboard the ISS at 26–28°C, under a 12-hour light/dark cycle.\n- Groups: Ground Control with Saline (GC-SAL), Ground Control with BuOE (GC-BuOE), Flight with Saline (FLT-SAL), and Flight with BuOE (FLT-BuOE).\n- BuOE (1 mg/kg) was administered subcutaneously once per week.\n- After return to Earth, mice were euthanized, and brains were sectioned for analysis.\n\nDigital Spatial Profiling (DSP):\nThe NanoString GeoMx DSP platform was used to quantify spatially resolved gene expression. Tissue sections were hybridized with Mouse Whole Transcriptome Atlas probes. Four regions (CT, FCT, CA1, DG) were imaged and sequenced using Illumina NovaSeq. Reads were normalized (Q3 method) and analyzed for differential expression using t-tests with multiple-test correction.\n\nStatistical and Bioinformatics Analysis:\n- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to visualize transcriptomic shifts.\n- Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) were defined as those with |log2FC| > 0.585 and q < 0.05.\n- Pathway analysis used KEGG and Enrichr databases.\n- Disease association mapping utilized DisGeNET for neurological disease gene correlations.\n- Overlap analysis between spaceflight- and BuOE-induced DEGs tested by Fisher’s Exact Test and permutation testing (1000 iterations).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nRESULTS\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n1. **General Transcriptomic Effects of Spaceflight**\n   Spaceflight exposure altered hundreds of genes in all four regions: 408 DEGs in CA1, 271 in DG, 189 in FCT, and 150 in CT. Each brain region exhibited unique transcriptional signatures, with limited overlap. PCA revealed that CA1 and DG were the most affected by spaceflight.\n\n2. **Top Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs)**\n   Notable genes affected include Ptgds, Cpne7, Cdkn2d, Msrb1, Bsph1 (CA1); Sst, Crygc, Psrc1, Abtb2, Kcna4 (DG); Arc, Ptgds, Col6a1, Tshz2 (FCT); and Arc, Ptgds, Mobp, Apod (CT). These genes regulate apoptosis, mitochondrial stress, neurotransmission, and myelination.\n\n3. **Pathway Enrichment**\n   - CA1: VEGF signaling, glycolysis, and oxidative phosphorylation pathways altered.\n   - DG: Calcium and cAMP signaling dysregulated.\n   - FCT: FoxO signaling and CoA biosynthesis disrupted.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
