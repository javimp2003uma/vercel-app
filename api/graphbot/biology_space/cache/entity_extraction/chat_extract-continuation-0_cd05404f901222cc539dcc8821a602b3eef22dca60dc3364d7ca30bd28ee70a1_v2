Estrogen status appears to influence how skeletal tissue responds to unloading. This could have implications for postmenopausal women in space, where hormonal and mechanical changes may interact to accelerate bone loss.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Experimental Design:**\n- Twelve-week-old female Fischer 344 rats underwent ovariectomy (OVX) two weeks before launch.\n- Groups: Ground Control (GC) and Flight (FLT), 12 rats each.\n- Rats were flown aboard Space Shuttle Columbia (STS-62) for 14 days.\n- Preflight calcein injections (20 mg/kg) labeled mineralizing surfaces for dynamic histomorphometry.\n- After landing, second lumbar vertebrae were collected for histological analysis.\n- All animals had ad libitum access to food and water in identical housing modules.\n\n**Histological Analysis:**\n- Vertebral sections were embedded in methyl methacrylate, stained with toluidine blue, and examined using fluorescence microscopy.\n- Measurements included cancellous bone area, fluorochrome label length, osteoclast perimeter, and MAT parameters.\n- Bone formation indices were derived from labeled surfaces and osteoblast adjacency.\n\n**Statistical Analysis:**\n- Data were compared using t-tests (with Levene’s and Anderson–Darling tests for normality and variance).\n- Welch’s t-test or Wilcoxon tests were applied where appropriate.\n- Significance was accepted at p < 0.05 after Hochberg adjustment for multiple comparisons.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\nCONCLUSION\n------------------------------------------------------\nThis study demonstrates that short-term spaceflight causes significant vertebral bone loss in OVX rats, accompanied by a dramatic increase in marrow adiposity. Despite this adipogenic shift, bone formation rates were unchanged, indicating that adipocyte expansion does not necessarily suppress osteoblast function under these conditions. Instead, bone loss results from enhanced osteoclastic resorption unbalanced by osteogenesis.\n\nThe findings support a model where spaceflight alters mesenchymal stem cell differentiation and bone remodeling coupling, especially under estrogen-deficient conditions. These insights are critical for developing countermeasures to protect skeletal integrity during long-duration space missions, particularly for postmenopausal astronauts or individuals with low estrogen levels.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\nFUNDING AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n------------------------------------------------------\nSupported by NASA (NNX12AL24G) and the National Science Foundation (DGE-0956280).\nThe authors declare no competing interests.\nData collection and interpretation were conducted at Oregon State University’s Skeletal Biology Laboratory.\n\nKeywords: Spaceflight, bone resorption, adiposity, osteoblast, osteoclast, ovariectomy, bone loss, microgravity, estrogen deficiency, vertebrae, bone remodeling.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SPACE SHUTTLE COLUMBIA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Space Shuttle Columbia was the spacecraft used for the flight experiment involving OVX rats to study bone loss in microgravity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NASA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>NASA is the United States government agency responsible for the nation's civilian space program and for aeronautics and aerospace research, which funded the study.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Oregon State University is the institution where data collection and interpretation were conducted for the study on bone loss in OVX rats.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OVX RATS<|>PERSON<|>OVX rats are a model used in the study to investigate the effects of microgravity on bone loss, specifically in the context of estrogen deficiency.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FISCHER 344 RATS<|>PERSON<|>Fischer 344 rats are the specific strain of rats used in the experiment to study the effects of spaceflight on bone health.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BONE LOSS<|>EVENT<|>Bone loss is the primary outcome measured in the study, particularly in the context of spaceflight and estrogen deficiency.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ESTROGEN DEFICIENCY<|>EVENT<|>Estrogen deficiency is a condition that influences how skeletal tissue responds to unloading and is a focus of the study's implications for postmenopausal women.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NASA<|>SPACE SHUTTLE COLUMBIA<|>NASA funded the study that utilized Space Shuttle Columbia for the experiment on OVX rats<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY<|>NASA<|>Oregon State University conducted the research funded by NASA<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OVX RATS<|>SPACE SHUTTLE COLUMBIA<|>OVX rats were flown aboard Space Shuttle Columbia to study the effects of microgravity on bone loss<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OVX RATS<|>BONE LOSS<|>The study measured bone loss in OVX rats as a result of spaceflight<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OVX RATS<|>ESTROGEN DEFICIENCY<|>OVX rats are used to model estrogen deficiency and its effects on bone health<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FISCHER 344 RATS<|>OVX RATS<|>Fischer 344 rats are the specific strain of OVX rats used in the study<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
