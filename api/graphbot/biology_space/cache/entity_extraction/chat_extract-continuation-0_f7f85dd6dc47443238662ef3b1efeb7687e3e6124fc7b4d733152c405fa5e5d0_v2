The goal was to understand sex-related differences in muscle atrophy and function, with implications for astronaut health and the development of countermeasures.\n\nBackground\n-----------\nProlonged spaceflight is known to cause muscle mass loss, reduced strength, and functional impairments. Data from astronauts show ~3% muscle mass loss per month, especially in the triceps surae and quadriceps. On Earth, HLS in rodents is the gold standard for studying unloading effects.  \nCountermeasures like exercise mitigate but do not fully prevent muscle loss. Importantly, little is known about how biological sex influences disuse-induced muscle atrophy. Prior animal studies suggest:  \n• Females may resist cachexia and atrophy better than males in some conditions.  \n• Male rats often show greater atrophy during unloading, but results have been inconsistent across studies.  \n• Human studies reveal mixed findings: some suggest women have greater neuromuscular decline after unloading, others show men experience more fatigability.  \nThis study specifically aimed to compare male and female responses to HLS in terms of muscle mass, function, histology, hormonal changes, and gene expression.\n\nMethods\n--------\n• **Animals**: 28 Wistar rats (14 male, 14 female, 14 weeks old).  \n• **Design**: 14 days of HLS vs. normal loading (NL). Rats were housed in individual cages, food and water provided ad libitum, and monitored daily.  \n• **Measurements**:  \n  - Body weight and food intake  \n  - Grip strength (front and rear paws)  \n  - Calf circumference as a proxy for muscle size  \n  - Maximal tetanic force production via nerve stimulation (plantar and dorsiflexion)  \n  - Histology of soleus and gastrocnemius: fiber cross-sectional area (CSA), fiber type composition, hybrid fibers  \n  - Pax7 immunohistochemistry: satellite cell abundance and myonuclear density  \n  - Blood assays: testosterone (males), estradiol (females), creatine kinase M (CKM)  \n  - RT-qPCR for genes linked to atrophy (Atrogin, MuRF1), myogenesis (MyoD, MyoG, Myf5, Pax7), and recovery (Ubr5, Sirt1).  \n• **Analysis**: Repeated measures ANOVA and two-way ANOVA with Tukey post hoc testing.\n\nResults\n--------\n1. **Body weight and food intake**  \n   - NL rats gained weight steadily; HLS males lost weight significantly, while HLS females maintained weight.  \n   - Food intake did not decrease overall; males consumed more than females. Interestingly, HLS females increased food intake slightly in week 2.  \n   - Limb girth decreased significantly in HLS animals of both sexes.  \n\n2. **Grip strength**  \n   - Baseline: males had stronger grip than females.  \n   - HLS caused a steep decline in rear paw grip strength in males (−53% by day 14), whereas females declined modestly (−22%).  \n   - Front paw grip was less affected, suggesting hindlimb-specific impact.  \n\n3. **Force generation**  \n   - Males had higher baseline plantar flexion force, but HLS prevented normal gains over time.  \n   - Females preserved dorsiflexion capacity under HLS, unlike males.  \n   - Overall, males showed greater force loss across tasks.  \n\n4. **Muscle mass and CSA**  \n   - HLS reduced muscle wet weight in gastrocnemius, soleus, tibialis anterior (TA), and extensor digitorum longus (EDL).  \n   - Losses were greater in males, especially in soleus (−40% vs. −33% in females) and TA (−17% vs. −10%).  \n   - Fiber-type specificity:  \n     • Males lost more type I (oxidative) fibers in gastrocnemius.  \n     • Females lost more type II and hybrid fibers.  \n   - Hybrid fibers increased in HLS males but not females, suggesting distinct remodeling.  \n\n5. **Satellite cells and myonuclei**  \n   - Satellite cell numbers showed a slight (non-significant) increase under HLS.  \n   - Myonuclear density rose significantly in both sexes, more in females (+50%) than males (+34%), potentially supporting regeneration and function maintenance.  \n\n6. **Hormonal changes**  \n   - Males: testosterone dropped sharply under HLS (−62% at 14 days).  \n   - Females: estradiol levels remained relatively stable, though slightly lower in week 2.  \n   - CKM (a muscle damage marker) did not differ significantly between groups.  \n\n7. **Gene expression**  \n   - Atrogin and MuRF1 (atrophy markers): no major sex-based differences, though MuRF1 trended higher in HLS females.  \n   - Myogenic genes (MyoD, MyoG, Myf5, Pax7): unchanged between groups.  \n   - Ubr5, linked to recovery, was significantly upregulated in females, indicating a potential protective mechanism.  \n\nDiscussion\n-----------\nThe study demonstrated clear sex-based differences in response to disuse. While both sexes experienced muscle loss, females preserved function better. Key interpretations include:  \n• **Hormonal influences**: Testosterone decline in males likely exacerbated atrophy, while stable estradiol levels supported female muscle maintenance.  \n• **Cellular mechanisms**: Females’ greater increase\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>WISTAR RATS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Wistar rats are a breed of rats used in scientific research, particularly in studies related to physiology and medicine, including muscle response to hindlimb suspension.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HINDLIMB SUSPENSION<|>EVENT<|>Hindlimb suspension is a ground-based model that mimics microgravity by unloading the hind limbs of rats, used to study muscle atrophy and function.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASTRONAUT HEALTH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Astronaut health refers to the study and maintenance of physical well-being of astronauts during spaceflight, particularly concerning muscle mass loss and functional impairments.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEX-BASED DIFFERENCES<|>EVENT<|>Sex-based differences refer to the variations in responses and physiological changes between male and female subjects, particularly in the context of muscle atrophy and function.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROLONGED SPACEFLIGHT<|>EVENT<|>Prolonged spaceflight is a condition where astronauts are exposed to microgravity for extended periods, leading to various physiological changes, including muscle mass loss.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MUSCLE ATROPHY<|>EVENT<|>Muscle atrophy is the loss of muscle mass and strength, often studied in the context of disuse or microgravity conditions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COUNTERMEASURES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Countermeasures are strategies or interventions, such as exercise, designed to mitigate the effects of muscle loss during conditions like hindlimb suspension or spaceflight.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HORMONAL CHANGES<|>EVENT<|>Hormonal changes refer to the variations in hormone levels, such as testosterone and estradiol, that can influence muscle response and atrophy in different sexes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENE EXPRESSION<|>EVENT<|>Gene expression refers to the process by which information from genes is used to synthesize proteins, which can be affected by conditions like hindlimb suspension.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HINDLIMB SUSPENSION<|>WISTAR RATS<|>Hindlimb suspension is conducted using Wistar rats to study the effects of muscle atrophy and function under simulated microgravity conditions<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HINDLIMB SUSPENSION<|>MUSCLE ATROPHY<|>Hindlimb suspension is a model used to study muscle atrophy and the physiological responses associated with it<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROLONGED SPACEFLIGHT<|>ASTRONAUT HEALTH<|>Prolonged spaceflight negatively impacts astronaut health by causing muscle mass loss and functional impairments<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COUNTERMEASURES<|>MUSCLE ATROPHY<|>Countermeasures are implemented to mitigate muscle atrophy during conditions like hindlimb suspension and spaceflight<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SEX-BASED DIFFERENCES<|>HINDLIMB SUSPENSION<|>The study of hindlimb suspension reveals sex-based differences in muscle response and atrophy<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HORMONAL CHANGES<|>MUSCLE ATROPHY<|>Hormonal changes, such as testosterone decline in males, are linked to increased muscle atrophy<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENE EXPRESSION<|>MUSCLE ATROPHY<|>Gene expression changes are studied to understand their role in muscle atrophy during hindlimb suspension<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
