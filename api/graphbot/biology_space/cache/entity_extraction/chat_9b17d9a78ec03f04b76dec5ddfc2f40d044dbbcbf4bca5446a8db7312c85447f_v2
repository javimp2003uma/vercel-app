These genes regulate apoptosis, mitochondrial stress, neurotransmission, and myelination.\n\n3. **Pathway Enrichment**\n   - CA1: VEGF signaling, glycolysis, and oxidative phosphorylation pathways altered.\n   - DG: Calcium and cAMP signaling dysregulated.\n   - FCT: FoxO signaling and CoA biosynthesis disrupted.\n   - CT: ECM-receptor and glycosphingolipid metabolism altered.\n   Oxidative stress-responsive pathways were consistently among the most affected.\n\n4. **Neurodegeneration Links**\n   Over 20 DEGs were linked to Alzheimer’s disease and other neurological disorders. Spaceflight may thus promote molecular signatures associated with neurodegeneration and aging, including dysregulation of metabolic and inflammatory pathways.\n\n5. **Effect of BuOE Treatment**\n   PCA revealed that BuOE shifted transcriptional profiles of flight mice toward those of ground controls, especially in CT and DG. BuOE significantly reversed expression trends in genes upregulated by spaceflight stress. Statistical tests showed that DEGs commonly changed in opposite directions under BuOE treatment (p < 10⁻⁵), confirming attenuation of spaceflight effects.\n\n6. **BuOE’s Mechanistic Action**\n   BuOE modulated genes within oxidative stress pathways:\n   - VEGF pathway: Normalization of Prkca in CA1.\n   - Calcium signaling: Restoration of Atp2b4 in DG.\n   - FoxO pathway: Downregulation of Homer1 in FCT.\n   - ECM pathway: Correction of Itga7 in CT.\n   BuOE also reversed several Alzheimer’s-associated gene alterations, indicating a protective effect against oxidative and neurodegenerative damage.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nDISCUSSION\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe results demonstrate that prolonged spaceflight induces widespread gene expression disturbances in the brain, predominantly in the hippocampal regions. These findings align with previous studies suggesting hippocampal vulnerability to radiation and microgravity. The transcriptional patterns point to oxidative stress, metabolic imbalance, and synaptic dysfunction as key contributors to neural impairment.\n\nBuOE treatment effectively counteracted many of these gene-level disruptions, especially those tied to oxidative damage and neurodegeneration. The antioxidant’s effect was region-specific, strongest in the cortex and weakest in the frontal cortex, implying differential regional sensitivities or antioxidant uptake dynamics.\n\nImportantly, alterations in circadian entrainment genes were observed, particularly in the DG region. This may help explain sleep–wake disturbances often reported during human spaceflight. These transcriptomic changes suggest systemic neurophysiological adaptations to disrupted circadian regulation.\n\nThe data collectively indicate that oxidative stress management is crucial for maintaining CNS integrity during long-term space missions. BuOE or related antioxidants could serve as effective countermeasures for mitigating spaceflight-induced CNS dysfunction.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nCONCLUSION\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n- Spaceflight induces significant, region-specific alterations in gene expression in mouse brains.\n- The hippocampus (CA1, DG) shows the highest vulnerability, particularly in pathways linked to oxidative stress and metabolism.\n- Several genes affected are associated with Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative disorders.\n- BuOE treatment attenuates many of these transcriptomic alterations, restoring expression of genes involved in stress response and neuronal health.\n- BuOE demonstrates promise as a potential neuroprotective countermeasure during space missions.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nFUNDING, DATA, AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nFunding: NASA Space Biology (NNX15AB41G, 80NSSC18K0310) and Loma Linda University Department of Basic Sciences.\nData Availability: GEO accession GSE239336, scripts available at https://github.com/ikremsky/Scripts-for-Kremsky-et-al.-GeoMx-DSP-mouse-spaceflight-study\nAcknowledgments: NASA Biospecimen Sharing Program and NanoString Technologies for DSP support.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nKeywords: spaceflight, oxidative stress, brain, hippocampus, cortex, BuOE, gene expression, neurodegeneration, antioxidants, digital spatial profiling, neuroprotection, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP5+.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
