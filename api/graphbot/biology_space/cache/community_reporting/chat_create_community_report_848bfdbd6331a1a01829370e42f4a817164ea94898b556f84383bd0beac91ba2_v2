It is characterized by unique stressors such as microgravity and radiation exposure, which can lead to various health risks. Notably, spaceflight may increase the risk of shoulder injuries due to unloading effects and has been linked to detrimental impacts on joint health, including reduced mechanical loading that affects knee joint cartilage and menisci in rodents.\n\nResearch has shown that long-duration spaceflight missions expose astronauts to unloading stress, which can impair muscle function and bone mass, as well as influence marrow adiposity. Additionally, studies have indicated that spaceflight affects liver metabolism and stress responses in mice, and it has been observed to impact gene expression and neurodegeneration. Furthermore, the physiological effects of spaceflight extend to plant life, as evidenced by its influence on the growth and development of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings.\n\nOverall, spaceflight
