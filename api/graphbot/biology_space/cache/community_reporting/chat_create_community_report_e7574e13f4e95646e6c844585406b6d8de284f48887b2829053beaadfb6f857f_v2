It is characterized by unique stressors such as microgravity and radiation exposure, which can lead to various health risks. Notably, spaceflight may increase the risk of shoulder injuries due to unloading effects and has been linked to detrimental impacts on joint health, including reduced mechanical loading that affects knee joint cartilage and menisci in rodents.\n\nResearch has shown that long-duration spaceflight missions expose astronauts to unloading stress, which can impair muscle function and bone mass, as well as influence marrow adiposity. Additionally, studies have indicated that spaceflight affects liver metabolism and stress responses in mice, and it has been observed to impact gene expression and neurodegeneration. Furthermore, the physiological effects of spaceflight extend to plant life, as evidenced by its influence on the growth and development of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings.\n\nOverall, spaceflight presents significant challenges to the central nervous system and poses various health risks that require careful consideration in the context of human and animal physiology.\",34\n174,BONE MARROW ADIPOSITY,Bone marrow adiposity refers to the increase in fat cells within the bone marrow observed during the spaceflight study.,1\n314,AHA2,AHA2 is a protein involved in the regulation of cell wall acidification and is affected by phosphorylation in response to microgravity.,1\n315,CESA1,CESA1 is a cellulose synthase protein that plays a critical role in cell wall synthesis and is influenced by microgravity conditions.,1\n316,SHOU4,SHOU4 is a protein that is involved in the regulation of cell wall synthesis and is affected by spaceflight conditions.,1\n364,ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE,Alzheimer’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder linked to several differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified in the study.,1\n367,METABOLIC IMBALANCE,Metabolic imbalance refers to the disruptions in metabolic pathways that were identified as contributors to neural impairment during spaceflight.,1\n370,CIRCADIAN ENTRAINMENT GENES,\"Circadian entrainment genes are genes that regulate the body's internal clock, which were altered during spaceflight, potentially affecting sleep-wake cycles.\",1\n368,GENE EXPRESSION DISTURBANCES,Gene expression disturbances are the changes in gene activity that were observed in the brains of mice subjected to spaceflight conditions.,2\n369,NEURODEGENERATION,Neurodegeneration refers to the process of neuronal loss and dysfunction that was linked to the gene expression changes observed in the study.,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n10,SPACEFLIGHT,MICROGRAVITY,\"Microgravity is a condition experienced during spaceflight, affecting astronaut health\",57\n196,SPACEFLIGHT,BONE MARROW ADIPOSITY,Spaceflight led to an increase in bone marrow adiposity in the ovariectomized rats,35\n365,AHA2,SPACEFLIGHT,\"Phosphorylation control of AHA2 is altered in microgravity, affecting cell wall acidification\",35\n366,CESA1,SPACEFLIGHT,Altered phosphorylation of CESA1 in microgravity affects cellulose synthesis,35\n367,SHOU4,SPACEFLIGHT,\"SHOU4 is involved in cell wall synthesis regulation, which is impacted by conditions in spaceflight\",35\n444,ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE,SPACEFLIGHT,The study linked gene expression changes due to spaceflight to pathways associated with Alzheimer’s disease,35\n447,SPACEFLIGHT,METABOLIC IMBALANCE,\"Spaceflight induced metabolic imbalance, which was identified as a key factor in neural impairment\",35\n449,SPACEFLIGHT,CIRCADIAN ENTRAINMENT GENES,\"Alterations in circadian entrainment genes were observed during spaceflight, affecting sleep-wake cycles\",35\n452,GENE EXPRESSION DISTURBANCES,NEURODEGENERATION,The gene expression disturbances observed were linked to neurodegeneration and aging processes,3\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
